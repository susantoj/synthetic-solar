Main Functions
--------------
- Aguiar_hourly_G0: generate annual sequence of hourly irradiances on a horizontal plane (W/m2)
- Aguiar_hourly_kt: generate sequence of hourly clearness indices for a single solar day
- Aguiar_daily_Kt: generate sequence of daily clearness indices given mean monthly Kt
- trend_sequence: generate annual sequence of hourly trend irradiances (no randomness)

Utility Functions
-----------------
- declination: calculate solar declination
- sunrise: calculate sunrise / sunset angle (in radians)
- eccentricity: calculate earth eccentricity correction factor
